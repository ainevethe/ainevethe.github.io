*Take it apart, put it back together again*. (Or at least try. And try some more. Does it work?  No?  Repeat, until it's back together again.)

I was the kid who didn't think Humpty Dumpty being broken was the catastrophe all the Kings horses and all the Kings Men seemed to think.  They were, rather, pretty lazy in my youthfully arrogant opinion.  They didn't seem to give it a fair shot at all to repair Humpty Dumpty!  

If it is broken, I believed, it was probably fixable.  
If it wasn't made yet, then start making it.  
I truly believed that if you could dream it, someone could do it. And if no one else had yet, could I try?? 

I tried to break my rubiks cube just to see how it worked.  (In the end I loved that rubiks cube too much to break my own, but eventually found a discarded one I could dissect.) 

It was just the way I was.  AM.

When I was a young child, there were no computers in the home. Not just our home, MOST homes.  They were "the owned" by NASA and BIG organizations and nowhere at all near massproduced yet and available in your average private home.  Our personal TV still used antanae (or a metal coat hanger, if I was desperate to get a hockey game!)  When I was still under 10, we had "portable" video game units ~ I had donkey kong, frogger and pac man.  I loved those games!  I carried them around with me everywhere.

Then, when I was around 12 or 13, my dad took the HUGE step of buying a computer. Yes, a brand spanking new Commodore-64, (not, of course, connected to the internet, though I would try and happily listen to that metallic beeping and watch the little dots grow accross the screen in my futile attempt.)  There was no Google (were the creators even born yet? Hmmm)  so after a library run to research how computers connect online, I realized the futility of my attempt.  My persuasive skills ended up equally failing when I tried to convince my father that it was vitally important that we be able to connect online.  The Internet would have to wait.

*(This was the bad boy!)*

But, there were text games.  And I played them. As many as I could get my hands on, at least.

I don't remember the day it happened, but one day I realized I could actually WRITE THINGS *(and have the computer tell me that I made no sense)*.  Which, though, implied that it ***would*** understand me if I did make sense.  So, I started to research by trial and error, what words DID make sense to my creamy plastic friend with its brown thick buttoned keyboard?  

Now, at that age, none of my female friends were at all interested in computers, and no male friend thought ***I*** should be, basically, I was on my own.  So, I learned to do something that I always enjoyed in real life that seemed possible to code for a very new beginner.  I coded very short "Choose Your Own Adventure" book's in BASIC (if memory serves).   I tried to take a high school programming course years later, but the teacher (unfortunately) was not interested in helping the couple of us brand new to computer programming so most of us just slowly lost interest.  

In the back of my mind, those early experiences remained. 

But I lived my life.  I went to college, got a job, got promoted, went back to school, worked a freelance business while my son grew up a bit and then finally had a chance to career-breathe when he was full-time in school.  I stopped and re-evaluated my life.  Was I happy?  Yes!  Was I challenged?  Wait.  No. No, I was not.   I wanted and needed a challenge. I also wanted to make a difference. 

During this introspective time I remembered my early coding experience.  As a person who has ALWAYS loved tech and all things tech or gadgetry, I wasn't intimidated by it. I built my own computer, broke it, fixed it, etc. I loved games, so I went and learned 3d animation, which was very creative, but sort of technical also.  Then recently, I came back to code.  It was easier to learn now because the number of learning resources was quite good online. When in doubt about what to do, there was also Google. (It felt like I could try anything with Google! If someone has EVER said "How do I..." there was an answer to that. For a knowledge-hound and prolific reader like myself, the internet is a gold mine.)   I coded when I could, even when I tried to teach myself poorly and made every mistake possible.  Because there was and IS a way, I just had to find it.  Coding was different.  I could fix things, which I enjoyed doing.  I could make things, which I also loved to do.   It gave feedback* (even when I didn't like it.)*  It was quantifiable.  It let me be logical without seeming overly Vulcanesque (tm).  It seemed like a good fit.  

And despite being dissuaded a couple of years ago by (well meaning) people who said that as a middle age woman I had two things going against me:  age and gender (I would *never* be hired, they said) I just kept coming back.  (*No-one would expect someone the age of their mom to know how to code.*  *dramatically stoic face*) And yet, again I would come back to learn to code.  I just kept coming back.  When things got hard and I would say "no, never again!" and I would leave and go for a walk...20 minutes later I would be back, trying again.  Again. *AGAIN.*

I realized I *wanted* to learn to code, and hopefully one day even code well.  That in the end it didn't matter if I was "too old" or "a girl" or even, god forbid, BOTH! A middle-aged woman who wasn't just the age of someone's mom, I AM someone's mom.  :) 

What mattered was that, like years before, I was the author of my story.  
And I am choosing my own adventure on this one.
